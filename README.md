# Tests the Collatz Conjecture, which states that, for any positive integer, a series of operations can be performed that will result in 1.

# If the integer is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. If it is even, divide by 2. Repeat until you end up with 1.

# The program tests the conjecture for a positive integer given by the user. When executed in the Python shell, the user can also run the conjecture with other inputs.

# The function run_tests tests this conjecture with values from 2-100, and it is true for all these values.
